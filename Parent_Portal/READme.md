# Parent Partal
This web application is basically for parents to see their children's institutional outcomes and activity.

# Motivation
The idea of building Parent Portal was to provide a platform for Parent's who want to see their children's institutional outcomes 
and activity. I found out there are not too many platforms in this segment to provide Parent's
with a chance to get updated with their children's results and progress.

# Key Features
Some of the standout features of the project are
1. Parent's can register and login
2. Can see their children's Registered courses and Live result's.

3. Admin can add new Advisor and Assign student under an advisor
4. Advisor can update courses and results of students
